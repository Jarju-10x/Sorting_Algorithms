# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice code for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C/C++. Currently, I have implemented the following sorting algorithms:

- [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
- [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
- [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
- [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)

Feel free to explore the code and try running the programs locally on your machine.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

- [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
- [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
- [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
- [Selection Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)

## TODO

Here are some sorting algorithms that I plan to implement in the future:

- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort
- Shell Sort
- Counting Sort
- ....

yet more to come.ðŸ˜‰
